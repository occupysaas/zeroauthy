# Plan 33 implementation record

Base: `5d1c30c1ac7c90d88307c1958af7d7fd20ef0d54`; branch `plan-33-mfa`.
Toolchain: Go 1.26.7 and Node v26.8.1. Work proceeds task by task; the
contract freeze does not imply runtime implementation.

## Task 1 — contracts

Public documentation and OpenAPI only; no upstream tenant observation.
M1–M9 remain open as described in D-0059 and the follow-ups. Go's shared type
and function namespace requires `Route(op string) RouteSchema`; the controller
approved this name. API generation produced `internal/gen/authapi/authapi.gen.go`
and `internal/gen/mgmtapi/mgmtapi.gen.go`. Published invalid device-name
constraints were omitted from the management schema.

The inherited RED log `/tmp/plan33-task1/red.log` records `go test
./internal/mfarules -count=1` failing because there were no non-test Go files.
`/tmp/plan33-task1/api-red.log` records the missing MFA create schema test.
The first combined green attempt exposed duplicate authentication YAML keys;
these were corrected, followed by the invalid upstream device-name schema.
See the Task 1 report for final commands and results. `TestPlan33LogCodes`
is explicitly skipped until Task 14, when runtime tasks have added emitters.

Verification (2026-11-02): `GOTOOLCHAIN=go1.26.7 make generate` exited 0;
`GOTOOLCHAIN=go1.26.7 go test ./internal/mfarules ./internal/logrules ./api
-count=1` exited 0; generated API packages compiled via `go test
./internal/gen/authapi ./internal/gen/mgmtapi -count=1` (no test files).
`TestPlan33LogCodes` was explicitly confirmed skipped. `git diff --check`
exited 0. Optional `make check-sources` was interrupted (exit 130) while checking
network URLs, so no result is claimed. Full suites remain Task 14 work.
